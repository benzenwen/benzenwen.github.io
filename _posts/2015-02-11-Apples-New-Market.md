[Apple's New Market](http://stratechery.com/2015/apples-new-market/)

Ben Thompson adds Apple's recent astounding quarter to evidence
against the Clay Christensen's low-end disruptive innovation
model... at least applied to Apple's business.  He ends with a sly
reference to the further disruptive possibilities of the Apple Watch.
To which,
[I agree](http://blog.benwen.com/opinion/product/2015/01/29/apple-pocket-phone/)
heartily.

Makes me wonder: What other businesses could this dis-commodification apply?
