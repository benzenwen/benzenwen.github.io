Seeing a Google self-driving Lexus on the highway, I
thought, "Will they ever be caught speeding?"

And if so caught, or involved in an accident, will the memory or
configuration of the computer or GPS be admissible evidence?

Would that be an incentive for manufacturers to install a speed
governor?

Would a sufficent fraction of speed-governed self-driving cars on a
stretch of highway cause median non-robotic drivers to otherwise slow
their pace?

Would the governor be a deterrance for rushed or thrill-seeking
drivers[^disclaimer] from enabling the computer, wanting the freedom
to exceed the legal speed limit?

With years of safety data, assuming any needed improvements in safety,
suggesting that self-driving cars are *safer* at speed, would there
then be a relaxation of the law thereby allowing robo-speeding,
effectively penalizing human speeders?  A side benefit would be higher
vehicle densities (with greater road wear) per unit time.

Would that make the manual driving of a car seen as reckless as not
wearing a seatbelt?

I, for one, welcome our new fast and furious overlords.
