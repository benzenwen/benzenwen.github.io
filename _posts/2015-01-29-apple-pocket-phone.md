There was a time when "watch" meant a pocket watch.

Wrist watches first appeared in the late 1800's as women's
jewelry. World War I soldiers and aviators, needing to co-ordinate
maneuvers, saw the utility of glanceable wristwatches.  From a NYTimes
[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/fashion/wrist-watches-from-battlefield-to-fashion-accessory.html?pagewanted=all)
on the subject, "an officer reportedly complained that operating a
pocket watch was difficult when timing a bombardment."

Today, we have to say *pocket* watch to mean those timepieces on a chain
in a waistcoat.

When wrist watches appeared, pocket watches disappeared.  That is
until they returned as cell phones and smart phones. Then wrist
watches became scarce.

I'm an early adopter of smart watches. I still have one of my Casio
DataBank watches from the 80's, and somewhere I have my very first
digital [watch](/assets/First%20digital%20watch.png). Its red seven-segment LEDs were powered on-demand to
save on precious battery life. Some things never change.

More recently, I backed the
[Pebble](https://twitter.com/benwen/status/279149789843714048)
kickstarter campaign as a developer.  I'm sheepishly proud to admit
that wearing my orange Pebble for 1.5 years, I exhausted its vibrating
motor. It's totally out of vibratrons, so I've dropped back to my
original developer edition Pebble.

I love my Pebble.

### Smartwatch:Smartphone::Wristwatch:Pocket Watch[^analogy]

Focus on *just* glanceability and notification for a moment. For short
bits of information like a discreet alarm, for looking at a Tweet,
screening caller ID, or checking the time (!), here's a smart watch's
glanceable utility: A smart watch is as much of an improvement over a
smart phone as a wrist watch was over a pocket watch.

Yes, there's other functionality that's useful, like activity trackers
and sleep trackers. New apps are being invented everyday.  Add
authentication and authorization (e.g. payments, vehicle ignition) and
the wearable gets personally powerful.  I'm bullish on
wearables,[^strap] and glanceability is the just initial hook.


Recall that a generation ago, this original 1983
[Compaq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_Portable) was
considered a portable computer at 28 pounds (13 kg). I'll go out on a
limb and say that in the future, our point of view will be similarly
shifted.  Power capacity, radiated power efficiency, UX, text input,
and 2-way communication will need innovation, but the bracelet form
factor will prevail. I'll be telling my grandkids, when rummaging
through the attic they unearth the musty, rigid, non-origami-folded,
brittle, watt-gulping, non-corneal-direct display iPhone 6, "Oh that?
It's an Apple *Pocket* Phone."

glanceability. Add link to TI watch. Thanks to Patrick, Steve, and Ana
