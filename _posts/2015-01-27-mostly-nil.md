A podcast that I've recently started to enjoy is
[RadioLab](http://www.radiolab.org) from [WNYC](wnyc.org).  I've been
absorbing the back catalog when driving, cooking or cleaning up after
dinner. The audio is cut together in a frenetic, simultaneous,
overlapping style that seems to compress the already chatty banter of
the hosts.  It quickens their pace to a neighborhood close to the
disturbing cadence of the old FedEx ad's
[John "Motormouth" Moschitta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeK5ZjtpO-M). Mixed
with ethereal sound effects and music, the podcast is a production
tour de force, bringing suspense and humanity to the nerdy topics they
cover, like the super-collaborative mathematician
[Paul Erdos](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91699-from-benford-to-erdos/).

What spurred me to write was this
[podcast](http://www.radiolab.org/story/dust-planet/) on an obscure
academic book,
[In the Dust of This Planet](http://www.zero-books.net/books/in-the-dust-of-this-planet).
Its sudden appearance in pop culture and fashion puzzled the author.
The book portrayed in the podcast is a study of Nilihism and
Pessimism, as applied to horror in pop culture. The story made me
think, hey that'd be a good name for a blog: *Almost nil*.
Listening to the podcast on the morning drive left me with an
emotional duality.  It left me feeling black emptyiness, and awoke my
always deferred desire to create.  So rather than waste a day doing
something fiscally productive, I spent a couple of hours sketching a
drawing for my wife for Valentine's Day.  It was something I'd been
planning on doing but never got around to it.  I can't say that it's
even mildly competent to stand as a work of art, but I was pleasantly
surprised by the outcome.  I'll have to report back later to see how
my lovely wife (MLW) views it.

The creative impetus also got me write in my blog today.

The new blog title has a geek double entendre in Lisp.  The opposite
of 't' or truth in Lisp is 'nil'.

I don't know enough about Nilihism or Pessimism to gauge if they
capture any profound truths.  Radiolab's vingette did remind me that
we should strive make something out of the little wisp of life we
have.

Speaking of our ephemeral wisp of time, I also, four weeks into the
year, ordered a 2015 calendar.  An improvement from 2014 by at least
two months.  Almost nil in the grand scheme of things though.
