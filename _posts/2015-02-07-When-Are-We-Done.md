I have a saying to remind myself how much further we can go in the
computer industry.  

"We're not done until I a) don't have to wait in line and b) never
have to fill out a form again."

Of course, I'm missing whole spectra of worthy goals in personal
expression, engineering craft, and scientific inquiry.  My two goals
speak to the workaday operational nature of IT.

The first goal concerns how we use information to drives resource
efficiency in business, government, and life. The second is about
authentication, authorization, and data access.  Both are about how
lazy I dream to be.
