With Radio Shack's situation looking dire, folks like Amazon and
Sprint are circling like vultures for its
[retail space](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/amazon-radioshack/)(Wired).

In early 2013, a friend of mine shipped me a package via an
[Amazon Locker](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_366591722_2?_encoding=UTF8&node=6442600011). The
locker happened to be in a mostly desolate Radio Shack near my
home. The email announcing that my package was in a locker named
Annika also included the above coupon.

It struck me as a little bizzare, that a bricks-and-mortar retailer
would lease out precious floor space to the enemy. I hoped for the sake of
Radio Shack shareholders that they were charging a pretty penny for
the privilege of becoming a transient UPS Store / Mailbox Etc.  The
coupon didn't work on me. I opened up my locker cell and struck up a
a quick conversation with the store staff.  Otherwise, I left
empty-handed. 

The retail location of the store is in the middle of a busy commercial
block.  A well-travelled light rail line runs half a block away.  A
Starbucks is across the street. A US Post Office, with actual PO
Boxes, is next door. 

For the small Radio Shack, the locker unit was huge, maybe occupying a
good 12 feet of shelf space four or five feet high.  This in a store
that maybe had 20x of that locker in total.

When I asked the staff about the locker, they said it was an
experiment.  The big computerized box
[disappeared](http://hothardware.com/news/Too-Close-For-Comfort-Staples-and-RadioShack-Remove-Amazon-Lockers-From-Stores)
a few months later.  Its departure was followed by at least two store
renovations in the year or so since.

Now think about the entire store filled with a gigantic Amazon
locker. It would be the exact opposite of a retail store.  That store
would be truly a store, as in storage, where every cubic inch of
product was always pre-sold.  It would the exact opposite of a Radio
Shack, where every cubic inch of product, it seems, will be never
sold.
