DRAFT

Reaction to Apple's FY2015 Q1 insanely successful quarter included
reportage about the forthcoming Apple Watch.  I'm an early adopter of
smart watches. I still have one of my Casio DataBank watches from the
80's, and somewhere I have my very first digital watch. It powered the
red LEDs only on-demand to save on precious battery life. Some things
never change.

More recently, I backed the
[Pebble](https://twitter.com/benwen/status/279149789843714048)
kickstarter campaign as a developer.  I'm sheepishly proud to admit
that wearing my orange Pebble for 1.5 years, I exhausted its vibrating
motor. It totally out of vibratrons. I still have my secondary black
Pebble, luckily for me.

Lucklily, I say because I love my Pebble.

Granted, it may be hard to imagine how simply useful it is to have
txts, email, and calls gently nudging you on your wrist.  A quick flip
of the wrist and I can see that my lovely wife is thinking about me,
or that a business associate needs some help right away.  I can know
quickly if it's a message I need to respond to immediately or if it
can wait.  It's very useful and convenient.  To the uninitiated, it
can seem to be only a trivial improvement over reaching into one's
pocket to check a phone.  Its convenience reset my expectations such
that I was longing for it when a weeks-long bug rendered it
flaky. (Shout out to the Pebble team for helping me!)

And there's other functionality that's usesful, like the activity
trackers and sleep trackers.  But nothing quite rivals the value of
notifications.  The value is both the discreet vibration-on-body and
the few characters of info to read. Add authentication and
authorization (e.g. payments, vehicle ignition) and the wearable gets
personally powerful.

## Smartwatch:Phone::Wristwatch:Pocket Watch*

Here's the best way I can describe its utility.  A smart watch
is as much of an improvement over a pocket phone as a wristwatch was
over a pocket watch.  Wrist watches first appeared as a bit of jewelry
and as a bit for technical miniaturization bragging rights for the
manufacturer.

It was World War I soldiers and aviators, needing to co-ordinate
maneuvers, who saw the utility of glanceable wristwatches.  Here's a
recent NYTimes

I'm bullish on wearables.**

No one outside of Apple can say right now that the first Apple Watch
is going to get everything right.  It'll certainly have weaknesses
that may seem Newton-like-fatal.  I suspect that Jonny Ive and team
learned from that debacle.  So there's a good chance that the first
Apple Watch will get enough right to delight.

I'll go out on a limb and say that in the future, our point of view
will be reversed.  That the wristwatch form factor will have us
looking back at the iPhone and telling our kids it's an Apple Pocket
Watch.

The Pebble is great, but it's also clearly limited.  That brings me to
a second analogy.  The Palm Pilot.  Palm Pilot : Pebble :: iPhone :
Apple Watch?
