What makes the concept of a smart watch intriguing?  Here's a metaphor
from the history of traditional watches.

There was a time when "watch" meant a pocket watch.

Wrist watches first appeared in the late 1800's as women's
jewelry. World War I soldiers and aviators, needing to co-ordinate
maneuvers, saw the utility of glanceable wristwatches.  From a NYTimes
[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/fashion/wrist-watches-from-battlefield-to-fashion-accessory.html?pagewanted=all)
on the subject, "an officer reportedly complained that operating a
pocket watch was difficult when timing a bombardment."

Now, we have to say *pocket* watch to mean those timepieces on a chain
in a waistcoat.

When wrist watches appeared, pocket watches disappeared.  That is
until they returned as cell phones and smart phones. Then wrist
watches became scarce.

I'm an early adopter of smart watches. I still have one of my Casio
DataBank watches from the 80's, and somewhere I have my very first
digital watch. Its red seven-segment LEDs were powered on-demand to
save on precious battery life. Some things never change.

More recently, I backed the
[Pebble](https://twitter.com/benwen/status/279149789843714048)
kickstarter campaign as a developer.  I'm sheepishly proud to admit
that wearing my orange Pebble for 1.5 years, I exhausted its vibrating
motor. It totally out of vibratrons. So I've moved onto my second 
Pebble.

I love my Pebble.

## Smartwatch:Smartphone::Wristwatch:Pocket Watch[^analogy]

For short bits of information: an alarm, looking at a Tweet or caller
ID, here's a smart watch's glanceable utility: A smart watch is as
much of an improvement over a smart phone as a wrist watch was over a
pocket watch.

There are other reasons I'm bullish on wearables.[^strap] But that
glanceability is the initial hook.

I'll go out on a limb and say that in the future, our point of view
will be reversed.  The watch form factor will prevail. We'll be
telling our grandkids, when rummaging through the attic
they unearth our musty, rigid, brittle, watt-gulping,
non-corneal-direct display iPhone 6, "Oh that? It's an Apple *Pocket*
Phone."
