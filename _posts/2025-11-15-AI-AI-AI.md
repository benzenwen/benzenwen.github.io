When some new techno trend "foo" arrives, I find myself repeating the
same chestnut: "Foo, foo, foo that's the answer, now remind me again
what was the question?" In my career there was an XML phase, a NoSQL
fever, a Cloud boom. That was followed by Node.js, Docker, Blockchain,
and for the last two years, AI. This AI one has lasted longer than the
rest (barring the Cloud one).

Now with the arrival of OpenClaw and orchestrators like Gas Town, the
AI trend looks to be here for another year or two.

These open source projects are early signals for the next area of
intense growth in software: long-running multi-agent systems. Both are
going to be a huge sink for tokens. They will burn a *lot* of
tokens. OpenClaw author at the first Claw-Con this week: "Ya, more
tokens. Someone has to support Anthropic." Steve Yegge in his latest
Medium post
[The Anthropic Hive Mind](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-anthropic-hive-mind-d01f768f3d7b):
"But there is a yellow brick road: spending tokens. This golden
shimmering trail will lead your company gradually in the right
direction."
