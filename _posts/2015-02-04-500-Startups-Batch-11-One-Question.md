I had the pleasure of attending the 500 Startups Demo Day for
[Batch 11](http://500.co/batch11-intro) yesterday.[^Tyler] I had a
great time. I'm humbled by the energy, effort, and enthusiasm. Wow.

Here are my completely biased[^biases], ungrammatical 1-minute
summaries of each of them.  I am absolutely sure that there are
errors, omissions, terrible mischaracterizations, and
me-being-just-plain-clueless.  The list below is not much more than a
quick exercise to scribble down what my uninitiated ears hear and
brain remembered after a day or two.

I also scribbled down the first question that came to mind as wrote
the summary.  That is not a criticism of any presentation at all.  To
prompt questions is a goal for these sessions.  It's just what came to
mind in recalling the pitch.

Starting a company is a frightening, maddening, exhilarating, worthy
endeavor. If you're reading this from one of the companies, y'all are
awesome.[^awesome] Let me know if I totally missed something, want to
answer the question, or heck if you just want to grab coffee.

I have to note that the mechanics of the presentations were
impressively smooth.  Thirty pitches in roughly 4 hours is not easy to
do. Thank you for putting together a great demo day!
