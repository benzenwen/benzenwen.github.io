I've noticed this trend recently, that startups are enrolling into more than one incubator.  It's generally sequential, but I've also heard of a nearly overlapping cycles.  Incubators can be great. And some specialize in a market or thesis such that the secondary "masters" degree builds towards a specialization the company needs.  Incubators that are geographically specialized may provide local networking and a large corporate program could leverage the existing assets of the parent organization. 

But it does make me wonder if we are overinvested on incubators, if they are chasing too few entrepreneurs.
