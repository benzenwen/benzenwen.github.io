Unfortunately, I'm in the category of vertigo sufferers when donning
the Oculus Rift. I tried one on tonight for the first time. I had it
on for maybe 10 minutes before I had to take it off.  I almost had to
look around for a barf bag.

A bit of a disappointment.

Back in 1995 I had a prototype head-mounted display shipped from
California for a Virtual Reality project we had undertaken.  I
distinctly remember the hand-wrapped package made from two boxes taped
together haphazardly.  The goggle's plastic was coarse and a bright
light green and black.  The duckbill shaped front was unbalanced.  The
latency was on the order of hundreds of milliseconds and had terrible
angular sensor resolution.  I think the screen had poor color
saturation and contrast.  I don't think it ever made it past the
prototype phase.

We had other prototypes and products, like the Virtual I/O, which may
have been the most popular at the time.

The Rift is far superior than those, but I still sense a very hobbyist
kind of experience.

There is some kind of irresistible siren song of 3D virtual reality
goggles for each generation of programmers. Prior to the Virtual I/O
generation, there were Evans and Sutherland displays that had to
be mounted on a articulated arm to support the weight.

I may no longer be in the demographic for these, but I understand the
appeal.  So here's a toast to the next generation!
