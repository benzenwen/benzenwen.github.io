![Vintage Newspaper Music Ad](/assets/RCA%20Cassette%20Tape%20Ad%202.png)

Music Bundling and Subscriptions have been around for a while. This is
what a bundled music ad looked like mid-1980's.  Retro!  But what's
with the gypsy?

Back in the day, I signed up for a competing service, the
[Colombia Record Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_House).
They had this Gold Box TV promotion, what today might be called an
Easter Egg or JetBlue Hacker Special.  If you saw the TV ad, you were
aware of an otherwise unlabeled small yellow rectangle on the print ad
that if filled out with an album number, would get you one more album.
What cross-channel marketing smarts that was! It made you feel like
you knew something secret, even though those TV ads were ubiquitous.

It worked on me.

What this RCA service and Colombia music service tucked away in the
fine print is an "opt-out" service. For my
grade-school enthusiasm, I didn't read carefully, despite the ad
following the FTC
[negative option plans](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=6ae79a215bd299fd401a63594e98ce70&ty=HTML&h=L&r=PART&n=16y1.0.1.4.50)
rules.

By ordering your promotional first few albums for some small amount,
you were *also* signing up for a monthly subscription. Each month, if
you didn't mail back an option card declining the Selection of the
Month, a new album arrived.  I recall receiving that first
subscription album where I missed the option card.  I now had this $10
bill to pay, but no money to pay for it. D'oh.

So the gypsy in the RCA ad here is a reference to that Colombia
subscription tactic.  The RCA program had a smaller minimum order.
Though once the year subscription ran out, you still had to "negative
option" each month's new album until you cancelled your
"membership". 

It's hard to make out in the photo, but the ad
has a mini Terms of Service in the blue order form.  It's right next
to the comical "tape penny here" circle[^penny]. It says:

> I enclose 1&cent;. Please accept my trial membership in the RCA Music
> Service and send me the 4 hits I've indicated here under the terms
> outlined in this advertisement.  A agree to buy just 1 more hit at
> regular Music Service price in 1 year's time -- after which I will
> receive a free bonus tape or record.  Then I may cancel my
> membership. (A shipping and handling change is added to each shipment.)

Reading the
[text](/assets/RCA%20Cassette%20Tape%20Ad%202%20Fine%20Print.png) of
the ad and comparing it to the FTC site, I can see the FTC rules
coming through, like the: "You'll always have 10 days to decide"
construction.

I wish I had [TOSDR](https://tosdr.org) back then. Not that my
13-year-old self would have read it.

Also, note in both the RCA and Colombia bundling services, there's two
levels of bundling here.  First is album itself, where one hit song
may drive the purchase of the entire album.  Second is that four other
albums are subsidized at the 1&cent; "purchase" price by two albums at
full price.  Today, the bundling is being done at the music stream
level, which the industry is sorting out right now.

(The ad is from a Sunday comics section of the Star-Legder. Sunday
comics were the only sections of the paper printed in color.)

[^penny]: To me, it seems "tape penny" trick was also a bit of sinister marketing genius. It let me, too young to have a checking account, pay for the first albums.
