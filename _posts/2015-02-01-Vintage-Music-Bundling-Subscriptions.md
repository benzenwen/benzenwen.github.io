![Vintage Newspaper Music Ad](/assets/RCA%20Cassette%20Tape%20Ad%202.png)

Music Bundling and Subscriptions have been around for a while. This is
what a bundled music ad looked like mid-1980's.  Retro!  But what's
with the gypsy?

Back in the day, I signed up for a competing service, the
[Colombia Record Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_House).
They had this Gold Box TV promotion, what today might be called an
Easter Egg or JetBlue Hacker Special.  If you saw the TV ad, you were
aware of an otherwise unlabeled Gold Box on the print ad that if
filled out, would get you one more album.  Cross-channel marketing
smarts that is because it made you feel like you knew something
secret, even though those TV ads were ubiquitous.

It worked on me.

What this RCA service and Colombia music service tucked away in the
fine print is that I signed up for an "opt-out" service. For my
grade-school enthusiasm, I didn't read the fine print, despite the ad
following the FTC
[negative option plans](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=6ae79a215bd299fd401a63594e98ce70&ty=HTML&h=L&r=PART&n=16y1.0.1.4.50)
rules.

By ordering your promotional first few albums for some small amount,
you were *also* signing up for a monthly subscription. If you didn't
mail back an option card electing to decline the Selection of the
Month, a new album arrived each month.  I recall as a grade schooler
with no money receiving that first subscription album where I missed
the option card, realizing that I now had this roughly $10 bill to
pay. D'oh.

So the gypsy in the RCA ad here is a reference to that Colombia
subscription tactic.  The RCA program had a smaller minimum order.
Though once the year subscription ran out, you still had to "negative
option" each month's new album until you cancelled your
"membership". 

It's hard to make out in the photo, but the ad
has a mini Terms of Service in the blue order form.  It's right next
to the "tape penny here" circle. It says:

> I enclose 1&cent;. Please accept my trial membership in the RCA Music
> Service and send me the 4 hits I've indicated here under the terms
> outlined in this advertisement.  A agree to buy just 1 more hit at
> regular Music Service price in 1 year's time -- after which I will
> receive a free bonus tape or record.  Then I may cancel my
> membership. (A shipping and handling change is added to each shipment.)

Reading the
[text](/assets/RCA%20Cassette%20Tape%20Ad%202%20Fine%20Print.png) of
the ad and comparing it to the FTC site, I can see the FTC rules
coming through, like the: "You'll always have 10 days to decide"
construction.

To me, it seems "tape penny" trick was also a bit of sinister
marketing genius. It let me, too young to have a checking account,
actually "pay" for the first albums.

I wish I had [TOSDR](https://tosdr.org) back then. Not that my
13-year-old self would have read it.

Also, note in both the RCA and Colombia bundling services, there's two
levels of bundling here.  First is album itself, where one hit song
may drive the purchase of the entire album.  Second is that four other
albums are subsidized at 1 cent "purchase" price by two albums at full
price.  Today, the bundling is being done at the music stream level,
which the industry is sorting out right now.

(The ad is from a Sunday comics section of the Star-Legder. Sunday
comics were the only sections of the paper printed in color.)
